# My-Introduction

I am a student at Numl Islamabad, seeking opportunities within the realm of web-based technology to gain invaluable industry experience.

I have embarked on a project-based learning journey to enhance my skills and understanding. I have created websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a foundation. I also worked with Laravel and React frameworks.

I've worked on side projects that highlight my technological abilities on websites like GitHub. Now, I'm keen to expand my knowledge and contribute to the industry through internships, part-time positions, and freelance work.
